# Machine Learning and Statistics Course Repository

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains materials related to the Machine Learning and Statistics Course offered at Atlantic Technical University during the Winter 22/23 Semester. It includes all the assessments and the final project.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several notebooks, each containing materials related to a specific topic covered in the course. These topics include statistical hypothesis testing, fitting data to a straight line using various methods, and using NumPy polyfit to fit polynomials to data sets. Additionally, there is an example demonstrating the use of Keras and TensorFlow to build and train a model for time-series anomaly detection.

The following is a brief overview of the contents of this repository:

* **Assessments:** This folder contains materials related to the various assessments and exercises completed during the course.
    - *Topic 1 - Statistics* - statistical hypothesis testing
    - *Topic 2 - Models* - exercise on fitting a data set to a straight line using three different methods
    - *Topic 3 - Parameters* - using parameters in the example of fitting polynomials to data sets
    - *Topic 5 - Time Series anomaly detection example* - demonstration of the use of Keras and TensorFlow to build and train a model for time-series anomaly detection
